    "A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps us to match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression."

    "the result of both of them will be basically computed using the BOADMAS rule according to mathematics so results will be different in both case. taking in terms of regular espressions it causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. (ab)c+ will match ‘ab’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘c’s; it will not match just ‘ab’. similarly for a(bc)+ it will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘bc’s; it will not match just ‘a’."
