    "Python provides the operator x += y to add two objects in-place by calculating the sum x + y and assigning the result to the first operands variable name x.

    "The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. Hence when we have to extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning we can use operator overloading,"
